  <h1 align="center">poseidon2</h1>
  <p align="center">
A zero dependency implementation of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323.pdf">Poseidon2</a> hash function.
The permutation function exposed by the Poseidon2 class is one-to-one compatible with <a href="https://github.com/HorizenLabs/poseidon2/blob/main/plain_implementations/src/poseidon2/poseidon2.rs">HorizenLabs/poseidon2</a>. 3kb gzipped ðŸŽ‰

# Install

```bash
npm install poseidon2
```

## Usage For Goldilocks Field, T = 12

### Permute

```javascript
import { permute } from "poseidon2/goldilocks-12";
const result = permute([
  1337n,
  123456n,
  100n,
  15n,
  1n,
  2n,
  3n,
  4n,
  22n,
  23n,
  24n,
  25n,
]);
```

### Two to One (Hash two 4-element-wide values)

```javascript
import { twoToOne } from "poseidon2/goldilocks-12";
const result = twoToOne([1337n, 123456n, 100n, 15n], [1n, 2n, 3n, 4n]);
```

### Sponge Hash with Pad (Hash n elements with padding)

```javascript
import { hashPad } from "poseidon2/goldilocks-12";
const result = hashPad([1n, 2n, 3n, 1337n, 9999n, 123n]);
```
